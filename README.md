# Data Analysis Final Project

This is the final project for Google Career - Data Analyst. This project belongs to the last course of the career, and has the objective to identify trends from a big data set, so marketing area from the company can improve their campaigns.

I used a free and public data offered by [MÃ¶bius](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic). The data set is: https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit. This is a project done with R and Spreadsheet. The analysis phases were: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share and act. 

***With the time, can be different edits.***
