# Data-Analysis-Final-Project-
This is the final project for Google Carrer - Data Analyst. This project belongs to the last course of the carrer, and has the objective to identify trends from a big data set, so marketing area from the company can improve their campaigns.

This is a project done with R and Spreadsheet. The analysis phases were: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share and act.
